# rsb
Tools for checking and finding r-step replica symmetry breaking (r-RSB) bounds for the independence ratio of random regular graphs.

Visit [this page](https://users.renyi.hu/~harangi/rsb.htm) to find more information about the results and some examples on how to use the codes.

Or read [the article](https://users.renyi.hu/~harangi/papers/rsb_bounds.pdf).

[check.sage](check.sage): a lightweight version for checking the claimed bounds (no derivatives or optimization, simply computing the bound)

[rsbopt.sage](rsbopt.sage): tools for numerical optimization of the RSB formulas
